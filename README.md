# Hierarchical Sensor Modeling Framework using Protocol Translator

This project is developing a full-system microcontroller unit (MCU) emulation which includes interface between various sensor.

Among the components, MCU emulation and translated binary execution engine was forked from the xPack QEMU Arm project.



## Status

Under construction..



## Quick Start 

We provide here a quick guide to installing framework, building example binaries connected with sensor through serial interface, and then running them on emulated MCU.
